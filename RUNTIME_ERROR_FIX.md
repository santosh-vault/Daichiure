# ðŸš¨ DEPLOYMENT RUNTIME ERROR FIX

## The Issue

Your build completed successfully, but the deployment is failing at runtime. This is typically caused by:

1. **Missing Environment Variables** (most common)
2. **Runtime JavaScript errors**
3. **Supabase connection issues**

## IMMEDIATE FIXES

### 1. Check Vercel Environment Variables

Go to **Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables**

**CRITICAL**: Ensure these are set for ALL environments (Production, Preview, Development):

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL = https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your_anon_key_here
```

### 2. Check Function Errors

Click on **"Details"** in the GitHub error message to see the specific error.

### 3. Check Deployment Logs

In Vercel Dashboard:

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. Look for **"Function Logs"** or **"Runtime Logs"**
4. Copy any error messages

## MOST LIKELY SOLUTION

The app is probably crashing because it can't connect to Supabase. Add the environment variables in Vercel Dashboard.

## Quick Test

Try accessing your deployment URL directly and check browser console for errors:

1. Open your Vercel deployment URL
2. Press F12 (Developer Tools)
3. Check Console tab for errors
4. Look for Supabase-related errors

## Next Steps

1. **Add environment variables** in Vercel Dashboard
2. **Redeploy** the project
3. **Check the "Details" link** in GitHub for specific error
4. **Share the specific error message** from either GitHub Details or Vercel Function Logs

The build works, so this is definitely a runtime configuration issue!
