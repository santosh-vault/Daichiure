# ðŸ”§ Vercel Build Optimization & Timeout Fix

## Current Status Analysis

Based on your logs, the build is starting correctly but might be timing out. Here are the fixes:

## 1. Add Build Timeout Configuration

Add this to your `vercel.json` to extend build timeout:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "daichiure",
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "NODE_ENV": "production"
    }
  },
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.js": {
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Optimize Build Performance

Add these optimizations to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build --mode production",
    "build:fast": "vite build --mode production --minify esbuild"
  }
}
```

## 3. Add Memory Optimization

Create `.vercelignore` to exclude unnecessary files:

```
node_modules
.git
*.log
dist
.vercel
.env*
```

## 4. Alternative Build Command

If the build is still timing out, try using the faster build command:

In Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Build & Development Settings:

- **Build Command**: `npm run build:fast`

## 5. Check for Memory Issues

Your build creates large chunks (690KB). This might cause memory issues on Vercel's 2-core, 8GB machine.

**Solution**: We can reduce chunk sizes by splitting them further.

## Next Steps

1. **Check if the build completed** - Go back to your Vercel deployment logs and scroll down to see if there are more logs after "vite v5.4.8 building for production..."

2. **If it's still running** - Wait a few more minutes, Vercel builds can take 3-5 minutes

3. **If it failed** - Copy the complete error message from the logs

4. **Try the optimizations above** if the build is timing out

## Quick Fix to Try Right Now

Update your build script to be more explicit:

```bash
# In package.json, change:
"build": "vite build --logLevel info"
```

This will provide more verbose logging to help diagnose the issue.
